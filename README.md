# Robotic Arm
The goal of this project is to build and program a robot arm that can draw polygons using a marker. Here you should build a robot arm that can move a marker mounted at its end across a piece of paper to draw arbitrary polygons given to it (at compile time). Given that polygon, the robot should move the marker to the first corner (without drawing a line) and then trace the shape on the paper. Drawing will be limited to a 15cm x 10cm area that can be located based on the kinematic characteristics of the robot constructed.
